				On Being Hollow
			</h1>
			
			<div class="space-y-6">
				<p>
					Sometimes life can feel empty, hollow, or void of meaning. This feeling is more common than you might think, and it's important to acknowledge and explore these emotions rather than dismiss them.
				</p>
				
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding the Feeling</h2>
				<p>
					The sensation of hollowness can manifest in different ways - a lack of purpose, emotional numbness, or a feeling that something fundamental is missing from your life. These experiences are valid and deserve compassionate attention.
				</p>
				
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Finding Connection</h2>
				<p>
					While feeling hollow can be isolating, remember that you're not alone in this experience. Many people navigate these feelings, and there are paths toward reconnection - with yourself, with others, and with meaning in your life.
				</p>
				
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Gentle Steps Forward</h2>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
