## Overview

**What does it mean to feel out of control?**  
Feeling out of control can happen when life feels overwhelming, unpredictable, or emotionally intense. You might feel like your thoughts are racing, your actions aren’t your own, or the world is spinning too fast. It’s scary — like something inside you is slipping and you don’t know how to catch it.

This feeling can come from anxiety, trauma, stress or intense life changes. It can also come during panic attacks, sensory overload, or emotional dysregulation.

## How to Help Yourself

You’re not actually broken — your brain is reacting to **threat or overload**. The aim is to **regain a sense of safety and control**, one small step at a time.

**Focus on the Physical First**  
- Press your feet into the ground and say out loud or to yourself where you are: _“I’m in my room. I’m safe. This will pass.”_  
- Try the **5-4-3-2-1** grounding method:  
  5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.

**Use Shock Techniques for Reset**  
- Hold an ice cube or splash cold water on your face  
- Do jumping jacks or run on the spot  
- Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6 — repeat  

**Externalise the Chaos**  
- Write down everything in your head. Don’t worry about spelling, grammar, or sense. Just _dump_ it out.  
- Make a list of what you *can* control right now — even small things (e.g., brushing your teeth, choosing music, closing a tab).

**Talk Back to the Spiral**  
- Thought: _“I can’t handle this.”_  
  Truth: _“I’ve handled difficult moments before. This will pass, too.”_  
- Thought: _“I’m out of control.”_  
  Truth: _“My body is in survival mode. I’m grounding myself.”_

**Slow Everything Down**  
- Give yourself permission to pause.  
- Mute notifications, dim the lights, and take 10 minutes just to *breathe*.  
- If possible, move to a space that feels calm and familiar.

## When & Where to Get Support

You don’t have to figure everything out alone. If you’re feeling overwhelmed regularly, it’s okay to reach out.

**Talk to someone:**
- A trusted friend or family member  
- A teacher or counselor (schools will usually have a counselor) 

**Professional help:**  
- Speak to your GP or doctor
- Therapists can help identify why you’re feeling dysregulated and teach tools to self-regulate  
- CBT and grounding-based therapy are particularly helpful  

**Helplines:**

## Useful Reminders

- Feeling out of control doesn’t mean you are out of control.  
- You can learn ways to bring yourself back — even if your brain tells you otherwise.  
- You are not “too much.” You are overwhelmed, and you deserve support.
