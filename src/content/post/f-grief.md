## Overview

Grief is the deep pain we feel when we lose someone or something that mattered to us. Most people associate grief with death, but it can also come from the end of a relationship, losing a pet, moving away, changing schools, or even losing part of yourself or your identity.

Grief is not one emotion — it’s a mixture of sadness, anger, confusion, numbness, guilt, and sometimes even relief. These feelings come in waves. There’s no timeline, and no “correct” way to grieve.

You don’t have to “move on.” You learn to live with the loss. You change, and carry it with you.

## How to Help Yourself

Grief isn’t a problem to fix — it’s a process to move through. You’re allowed to hurt. You’re allowed to take your time.

**Let yourself feel what you feel**  
- Don’t judge yourself for how you’re grieving. There’s no “right” pace or emotion.  
- You might cry every day or not at all. Both are valid.

**Find ways to express it**  
- Write a letter to the person or thing you lost  
- Talk to someone you trust, even if you don’t have the words  
- Use music, art, poetry, or journaling to let the feelings out safely

**Keep small routines**  
- Do one or two predictable things each day — brush your teeth, eat lunch, get dressed  
- Routines offer structure when everything else feels chaotic

**Be kind to your energy levels**  
- Grief is exhausting. Rest is not laziness — it’s part of recovery  
- Avoid overloading yourself with school, socialising, or decisions if possible

**Make space to remember**  
- Keep a photo, write down memories, plant something, or light a candle  
- You don’t have to forget to move forward — remembrance can be healing

**Let others in**  
- You don’t need to talk about it every time — just being around someone kind can help  
- Tell someone what support *you* need (e.g. “Can you sit with me?”, “I just want to vent.”)

## When & Where to Get Support

Grief is not something you need to “get over” to be okay. But if it starts to feel unmanageable, ongoing support can really help.

**Talk to someone you trust:**  
- A parent, friend, teacher, or sibling  
- Just saying “I’m struggling with this loss” is enough to open the door

**Professional support:**  
- School counsellors, therapists, or grief support workers  
- Therapy can help make sense of loss and offer ways to live with it

## Useful Reminders

- Grief doesn’t mean you’re broken — it means you loved deeply.  
- There’s no rush. You don’t have to be “okay” by any certain time.  
- It’s okay to laugh again. It’s okay to cry again. It’s okay to still miss them.  
- You’re allowed to grieve in your own way. And you don’t have to do it alone.
