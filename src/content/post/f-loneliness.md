## Overview

Loneliness isn’t just about being alone — it’s about feeling unseen, disconnected, or like no one truly understands you. You can feel lonely in a quiet room or in a crowded hall. You can even feel lonely around your own friends or family.

It’s a painful feeling, and it often makes us believe we’re the only ones going through it. But loneliness is far more common than it seems — especially in moments of change, loss, or self-doubt.

You are not weird, broken, or failing for feeling lonely. You are craving connection, and that’s deeply human.

## Signs & Symptoms

- Feeling left out, isolated, or like no one notices you  
- Wanting to reach out, but not knowing how  
- Scrolling social media and feeling worse afterwards  
- Thinking you’re “too much” or “not enough” for others  
- Worrying that if you disappeared, no one would care  
- Physically being with people but still feeling alone

## How to Help Yourself

Loneliness can feed itself — the more we feel it, the harder it gets to break the cycle. But there are gentle ways to start reconnecting with others and with yourself.

**Acknowledge it without shame**  
- Say it out loud or write it down: “I feel lonely right now.”  
- Naming it can reduce its power and help you respond with kindness instead of judgment.

**Find one small point of connection**  
- Message someone even if it feels awkward. You don’t have to say much — just “hey” or “how are you?”  
- Join a group, game, or space online or in person where you can be around others with similar interests  
- Even brief, low-pressure social moments can remind your brain that connection is possible

**Reconnect with yourself**  
- Loneliness can also be a disconnection from your own identity  
- Do something that makes you feel like *you* — music, art, movement, journaling, even sitting in nature  
- You matter even without others’ approval

**Resist the comparison trap**  
- Social media often makes people look far more connected than they are  
- Behind every perfect photo is someone else struggling in silence too

**Start with consistency, not intensity**  
- You don’t need a deep conversation every time  
- Just regular interaction — a daily text, a smile at someone in school, a short walk with a friend — builds connection gradually

## When & Where to Get Support

Feeling lonely doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong. But if it’s becoming overwhelming or long-term, support can make a big difference.

**Talk to someone if you can:**  
- You don’t have to open up fully — just saying “I’ve been feeling a bit alone lately” is enough  
- Teachers, friends, parents, or siblings may not realise you need support until you share it

**Professional support:**  
- School counsellors or therapists can help you explore why you’re feeling this way and offer tools to rebuild connection  
- Therapy can also help if you’re experiencing social anxiety alongside loneliness

## Useful Reminders

- You are not the only one feeling this way — even if it really feels like it  
- You’re not “too much” or “not enough” — you’re worthy of connection as you are  
- You don’t need to become more popular to feel less alone — you need real connection, even with just one person  
- You are seen. You matter. You are not invisible.
