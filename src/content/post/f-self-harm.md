## Overview

Self-harm is when someone deliberately hurts themselves as a way to cope with emotional pain, intense stress, or overwhelming thoughts. It can take many forms — from cutting, scratching, or hitting oneself to less obvious behaviours like restricting food, pulling out hair, or misusing substances.

Self-harm is not attention-seeking. It’s often hidden, and it’s usually a sign that someone is feeling things they don’t know how else to express or manage.

It can feel like the only relief in the moment — a release, a distraction, or a way to feel something instead of nothing. But over time, it usually leads to more shame, secrecy, and distress. You deserve support that helps, not hurts.

## Why People Self-Harm

Everyone’s reasons are personal, but some common ones include:

**To express pain**  
- When emotions are too hard to put into words, self-harm can feel like a language of its own

**To feel in control**  
- Hurting yourself may feel like the only thing you can control when everything else feels chaotic

**To feel something**  
- Some people feel numb or disconnected, and self-harm can temporarily break that emptiness

**To punish yourself**  
- If you believe you’re worthless or deserve pain, self-harm can become a form of self-punishment

**To cope with overwhelming emotions**  
- It may seem like the only way to release anxiety, anger, sadness, or self-hate

No matter the reason — it matters. You matter. And you are allowed to seek a safer way to cope.

## How to Help Yourself

Self-harm doesn’t make you broken. But it is a sign you need support — and there *are* healthier ways to survive the pain.

**Understand your triggers**  
- Try writing down what was happening before you felt the urge: situations, thoughts, emotions  
- Over time, patterns can emerge — and once you know what sets you off, you can build strategies around those moments

**Create a delay**  
- Tell yourself: “I’ll wait 5 minutes before acting on this.”  
- Then try something else — walk, stretch, scribble hard on paper, clench an ice cube, tear up paper, hit a pillow  
- You may still feel the urge, but every time you delay, you give yourself power and space

**Use safer alternatives**     
- Hold ice tightly in your hand  
- Scream into or punch a pillow 
- Scribble onto paper
- Scrunch up paper
- None of these are long-term solutions, but they can break the cycle in the moment

**Soothe the emotion, not just the urge**  
- If you're angry: try exercise, punching a pillow, loud music  
- If you're sad: curl up somewhere safe, watch a comfort show, listen to calm music  
- If you're numb: hold cold water, watch an intense movie, dance or sing loudly  
- Matching the coping to the feeling is often more effective

**Make a coping box or plan**  
- Fill it with distractions, comforting items, reminders, breathing exercises, messages for your future self 
- Having it ready makes it easier to act on support than on harm

**Build a support system**  
- You don’t have to do this alone  
- Whether it’s a friend, a therapist, or an online space, connection heals

## Useful Reminders

- Self-harm is a *response* to pain — not who you are  
- You are not weak — you’ve been surviving the only way you knew how  
- You are not alone — more people than you think are quietly fighting this  
- You are not beyond help — support exists, and healing is possible  
- You deserve to feel better without hurting yourself to get there
