## Overview

Suicidal feelings can show up in many forms. They might be thoughts like:

- “I can’t do this anymore.”
- “Everyone would be better off without me.”
- “I just want everything to stop.”

Or they might be a numbness — not wanting to die exactly, but not wanting to live like this either.

If you’re feeling this way, **you are not alone**. Many people go through times where life feels too heavy, too painful, or too empty to keep going. But these thoughts and feelings are **not permanent**, even when they feel overwhelming. There is support. There is a way through. And you are worth helping.

## What Can Cause Suicidal Thoughts?

Suicidal feelings usually come from **overwhelming emotional pain**, not a desire to die. That pain might come from:

**Depression or mental illness**  
- When nothing brings joy, and everything feels pointless or exhausting

**Grief, trauma or loss**  
- After losing someone or something that felt like part of you

**Loneliness or feeling misunderstood**  
- When it feels like nobody gets you, or you’re truly on your own

**Bullying, abuse or mistreatment**  
- Feeling trapped, unsafe, or worthless because of how others treat you

**Hopelessness about the future**  
- When you can't imagine anything ever getting better

**Feeling like a burden**  
- When you think you’re causing others pain just by existing (this is **never true**, even if your brain says it is)

## How to Help Yourself in the Moment

You are not weak for feeling this way — you're **in pain**, and pain needs care, not shame.

**Tell someone**  
- You don’t have to give the whole story. Just say:  
  “I’m really struggling and don’t feel safe right now.”  
  “I don’t want to be here anymore.”  
  “I need someone to talk to.”  
- You can speak to a friend, family member, teacher, or helpline

**Make a safety plan**  
- Write down or save a plan:  
  1. Who to contact  
  2. Where to go  
  3. What helps you feel grounded  
- StillSpace can become part of your plan — return here when things feel too much

**Use grounding techniques**  
- Focus on 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste  
- Hold ice, pace the room, run cold or warm water on your hands  
- Say out loud: “These thoughts are not facts. I can get through this.”

**Remove means of harm if you can**  
- If you feel unsafe with anything nearby, try to move to another space or tell someone immediately

**Delay the action**  
- Tell yourself: “I won’t act on this for at least 10 minutes.” Then another 10. Give your brain time to cool the storm

**Write it out or speak it**  
- Emptying your thoughts into a notebook, app, or voice note can release pressure  
- Even if it doesn’t fix the feeling, it helps stop it growing

## Longer-Term Ways to Support Recovery

**Professional help**  
- Therapy can help you process pain and build new ways of coping  
- GPs and counsellors can connect you with the right support

**Routine and structure**  
- Make small daily goals — brushing teeth, going outside, eating one meal  
- Tiny successes rebuild a sense of self-worth and momentum

**Connection**  
- Build honest, safe relationships. If you don’t have those now, that doesn’t mean you never will  
- Try online communities for mental health support (moderated ones)

**Creative expression**  
- Turn pain into poetry, journaling, music, or art. Expression is release

**Crisis resources you keep on hand**  
- A grounding list  
- A letter to yourself from a clearer moment  
- A photo or playlist that reminds you you’re still here

## You Deserve to Stay

You might not believe it right now, but you are not broken. You are not a mistake. You are not a burden.

You are a whole person carrying pain — but pain can be healed. Life can still shift. You are loved more than you know, and the world is better with you in it.
