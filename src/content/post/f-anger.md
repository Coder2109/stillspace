## Overview

**What is anger?**  
Anger is a natural human emotion that everyone experiences. It's the body's way of reacting to threats, unfairness, or feeling hurt. Anger itself isn't bad — it can motivate change, signal when boundaries have been crossed, or give us energy to stand up for ourselves.

But when anger becomes overwhelming, frequent, or hard to control, it can damage relationships, affect your mental health, and make you feel guilty or out of control.

You’re not a bad person for feeling angry. The key is learning how to **understand** anger rather than fear it — and finding safe, healthy ways to deal with it.

## How to Help Yourself

Anger often covers up **other emotions** like fear, sadness, or feeling unheard. These strategies can help you understand and release anger safely:

**Notice the Triggers**  
- Is your anger caused by feeling powerless, ignored, embarrassed, or hurt?
- Keep a log of when anger shows up — patterns can reveal the cause.

**Name the Feeling Beneath**  
- Ask yourself: _"Am I angry, or am I actually feeling hurt, rejected, or scared?"_
- Labeling the emotion makes it easier to handle it.

**Grounding Techniques**  
- Deep breathing: In for 4, hold for 4, out for 6  
- Splash cold water on your face or hold something cold  
- Walk away from the situation until your body calms down

**Get It Out Safely**  
- Journal everything you're thinking — no filter  
- Scream into a pillow, punch a cushion, run it off  
- Use music, drawing, or movement to express the emotion without harming anyone (including yourself)

**Use CBT Thought Flipping**  
- Angry thought: _“They always treat me like dirt!”_  
- Reframe: _“It felt like they disrespected me. I need to set a boundary.”_

**Build an “Anger Pause”**  
- Practice noticing the **10 seconds** before reacting
- Ask: _“Will what I say now help or hurt me later?”_
