## Overview

Everyone feels down sometimes — it’s part of being human. But when those feelings stick around, make everything feel harder, or start affecting your motivation and energy, it’s important to acknowledge what’s going on and know that you’re not alone.

Feeling low can come from many things: stress, rejection, burnout, loneliness, or even no obvious reason at all. It doesn’t always mean you have depression, but it can be a sign that your mind and body need care and support.

Feeling down doesn’t make you weak. It makes you human. And there are ways through it.

## How to Help Yourself

You don’t have to wait until you hit breaking point to take action. Small, kind steps make a real difference over time.

**Name the feeling**  
- Say it out loud or write it down: “I feel low right now.”  
- Giving it a name gives you space from it — you’re observing, not becoming it.

**Check the basics**  
- Have you eaten something nourishing today?  
- Have you drunk water, got fresh air, or moved your body at all?  
- Lack of basic care can worsen emotional lows.

**Do something small and gentle**  
- Choose one low-effort action: shower, tidy a small area, walk outside.  
- Even a 1% shift helps your brain start building momentum again.

**Use self-compassion, not criticism**  
- Instead of saying, “What’s wrong with me?” try: “I’m finding this hard, but I’m doing my best.”  
- Your inner voice matters. Try to make it sound like a friend.

**Create a 'calm kit' or comfort list**  
- Write down 5 things that usually soothe you (e.g., music, drawing, a movie, a blanket, a scent).  
- Keep it accessible for low days when making decisions feels impossible.

**Talk to someone if you can**  
- You don’t have to share everything. Just saying, “I’ve been feeling low” can be enough.  
- Sometimes the act of being heard is a first step to feeling lighter.

## When & Where to Get Support

If feeling low has lasted more than two weeks, or it’s affecting your ability to function, it might be time to ask for help. This isn’t a sign of failure — it’s a step toward healing.

**Talk to someone you trust:**  
- A trusted friend or family member  
- A teacher or counselor (schools will usually have a counselor) 

**Professional support:**  
- Speak to your GP or doctor
- Therapy can help you understand why you’re feeling this way, and how to move forward  
- CBT, talking therapy, or even short-term check-ins can make a difference

## Useful Reminders

- Feeling down doesn’t mean you’re failing — it means something needs care.  
- You won’t feel this way forever, even if your brain tries to convince you otherwise.  
- Help is real, and it is for you. You don’t have to do this alone.
