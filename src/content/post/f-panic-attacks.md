## Overview

A panic attack is a sudden, intense wave of fear or discomfort that triggers physical and emotional reactions — even when there’s no obvious danger. It can feel like your body is shutting down, speeding up, or totally out of control.

During a panic attack, your body activates its “fight or flight” system. This reaction is designed to keep you safe from real threats — but in a panic attack, it misfires, overwhelming you with adrenaline, fast heartbeats, and racing thoughts.

Panic attacks are frightening, but they are not dangerous. You are not dying. You are not going crazy. And most importantly — you are not alone.

## Signs & Symptoms

- Racing or pounding heart  
- Shortness of breath or feeling like you can’t breathe  
- Dizziness or feeling faint  
- Chest pain or tightness  
- Nausea or stomach discomfort  
- Sweating or chills  
- Shaking or trembling  
- Feeling detached from your body or reality  
- Fear that something terrible is happening — or about to happen  
- Intense need to escape the situation  

Panic attacks often peak within 10 minutes and subside within 20–30 minutes. Afterward, you may feel drained, confused, or emotional.

## How to Help Yourself

**Recognise what’s happening**  
- Say to yourself: “This is a panic attack. It’s scary, but it will pass.”  
- Remind yourself that panic attacks can’t hurt you, even if it feels like they will.

**Use grounding techniques**  
- Focus on your senses: Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste  
- Hold onto a familiar object or run your hands under cold water  
- Sit down and press your feet into the floor to remind yourself you are here, now, and safe

**Control your breathing**  
- Panic attacks often make you breathe fast or shallow — slowing this down helps signal safety to your brain  
- Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6 — repeat 
- You can also breathe along with a visual — such as a shape expanding and contracting or your hand tracing

**Don’t fight it — ride the wave**  
- Fighting the panic may fuel it. Instead, try to allow it to move through you  
- Think: “I can let this feeling rise and fall without fear”  
- The goal isn’t to stop it instantly, but to stay with yourself until it passes

**Aftercare is important**  
- Take some quiet time to recover — you might feel tired or emotional afterwards  
- Do something comforting and familiar (tea, soft music, safe space)  
- You did something hard — and you made it through
