# On Anxiety

This feels like a good place to start, because it’s where everything began to tilt. A few years ago, I completely shut off socially. I had no real friends and didn’t speak to my family much. I was shy and awkward. Whenever I tried to speak, I could never find the right words. I’d trip over my sentences and regret almost every one that actually left my mouth.

Most of the time, I just stayed quiet. It felt safer that way. If I never spoke, I could never say anything wrong. There was no risk. But I later learned it came at the cost of friendships, relationships and self-worth. A cost that wasn't worth it.

Anxiety is just living slightly ahead of yourself in time. Always braced for a moment that may never arrive. It's like fear's older brother. Fear is loud and impulsive; anxiety is quiet and patient. It slowly devours hope, replacing it with a hollow kind of safety.

I remember one day in particular. I was at a party at a friend’s house. Everyone was huddled together, and I stood in the far corner of the room, watching people laugh and joke. I wanted to join in, but I didn’t feel like I belonged.

I could feel the weight of every possible thing I could say wrong pressing on my chest. The judgement, the embarrassment. So I stayed quiet, sipping my drink, wishing I could disappear.

I could’ve sworn my crush (at the time) and my best friend looked over at me and laughed, in a making-fun-of-me kind of way. I guess I’ll never know if they really did or if I made it up in my head. That’s the thing with anxiety: it convinces you of things you can’t prove right or wrong.

I eventually made some stupid excuse about needing to leave early. And that was it. The next few weeks were spent slowly separating myself from everyone, telling myself I didn’t belong. Maybe I didn’t. But I wasn’t really helping myself.

Other times, it was smaller things: asking a question in class, texting someone first, or just walking down a crowded hallway. My mind would instantly jump to worst-case scenarios, creating a loop I couldn’t escape. I’d rehearse conversations over and over, type out messages before sending them – editing, deleting, rewriting – until even the simplest interactions became too hard for me.

My dad would always tell me about how he struggled with this too when he was younger. He said you just had to throw yourself out there, even when it felt impossible. 

I didn’t believe him at first. How could anyone feel that way and make it to the other side? But slowly, I began to test it. I started small: saying hi to someone I didn’t know well, answering a question in class, making one joke that landed. Each tiny victory became a crack in the wall anxiety had built around me.

And he was right. You just have to dive in the deep end sometimes. You'll find that not everybody is out to get you, and that most people are actually quite nice. The ones who aren’t? You can let them pass, they aren’t worth your worry or anxiety in the first place.

Anxiety also teaches you things (whether you like it or not). It teaches you patience, awareness and self-reflection. You notice all the little things in the world. Somebody’s smile when they think no one’s watching, the way the world is so alive, the rhythm of your breathing when panic is yet to take hold. It just teaches you this in such a cruel way that before you notice these good things it gives you, it reminds you of all the ways you could lose it all in a second.

But you can learn to see past it. 

Sometimes it still whispers in my ear. “You’re going to mess this up. You don’t belong here. They’re going to notice.” Other days, it’s quieter – not gone, just softer – and I can hear my own thoughts underneath the noise, separate from the static. That’s usually when I realise the difference. Anxiety hasn’t disappeared; I’ve just learned how to recognise which voice is actually mine.

I’ve started treating anxiety less like an enemy and more like an overprotective part of my brain that doesn’t always know when to stop. I notice it now. I name it. I tell it I hear what it’s saying, and then I decide what to do anyway. Sometimes that helps. Sometimes it doesn’t. The important part is that I don’t mistake its volume for truth anymore.

I don’t think living like this is about winning or beating anything. It’s about showing up even when your chest feels tight and your thoughts feel tangled. It’s about learning that discomfort doesn’t mean danger, and that the bad moments pass. Over time, the moments that once felt impossible become survivable. Occasionally, they even become meaningful.

Anxiety is exhausting and isolating, but it has also forced me to understand myself in ways I never would have otherwise. It has taught me how closely I pay attention – to people, to silence, to myself. It’s forced me to slow down and actually look at what I’m afraid of losing, which helps me figure out what I care about most.

I don’t have this figured out. I still hesitate. I still overthink. But I’m learning how to live alongside it instead of letting it shrink me down. And if any part of this feels familiar, if you recognise even a small piece of yourself here, then maybe that’s enough. Sometimes knowing you’re not the only one standing quietly in the corner can make it a little easier to step forward.

And that matters.
