# The Fall


There was a moment, just before, where everything stood still.\
I was weightless.\
Not falling. Not floating.\
Just… held.\
Held by a force that didn’t exist.

Then a sound.\
A low hum.\
Like an old fluorescent ceiling light. Growing. Slowly. Louder.

I had never felt so alone.\
So far removed from anything.\
My mind was empty. Numb.

They said it wouldn’t hurt.\
They were right.

But it wasn’t peace either.

—

As I was held,\
I drifted backwards,\
far, far back,

Memories that I had almost forgotten.

I thought over them...


___


Daybreak.

        The sun rose just enough\
                to reveal a cloud.

        Upon the cloud\
                sat a boy.

        As the sun reached higher,\
                the boy felt warmth\
                        on his shoulders.

        He felt the light breeze\
                on his face.\
        He heard the birds sing\
                all around him.

        He hummed a melody.\
                A simple one.\
        Yet within it,\
                everything lived.

        He sat,\
                and he hummed,\
                        and he waited.

        He didn’t worry about looking down,\
                because he was sure\
                        he would never have to fall.

        He was happy.\
                It was perfect.

                        For a moment.

Keep your head down, not that the sky was an interesting view,\
The same old shade of grey leaned over me and laughed down.\
I forced my feet forward: left, right, left, right.\
The pavement blurred beneath me as I walked.

Whispers of thoughts echoed round my head.\
I felt completely surrounded by everyone and everything but…\
Nothing ever reached me.\
I continued moving forwards.

I thought of change, from every moment I had lived before:\
To be happier somehow, maybe by lifting my head, or speaking to a stranger.\
But yet still, all the energy I could bring myself to find\
Was used to perform the same routine: left, right, left, right.\
And so this was how it was, and how it is, and how it will be.\
The kid who keeps his head down was who I was supposed to be.

I tried to take a deep breath in\
but I only sped up.\
How could I find peace here?

Alone in my room.\
The walls closed in around me:\
everythingwastooclosetogether.

My head was pounding. \
My chest tightened. \
I struggled to form— \
    —to form any kind of thoughts. 

Everything was slowly fading: \
the room, \
     the light, \
          myself. 

Suddenly, everything was dark.

I was on the floor. \
I tried to get up,\
     (but you never can, can you?) \
I tried to look for any kind of hope,\
     (but you will never find any)\
I was all alone, \
     (and you always will be).  

“it’s alright,”\
I tell myself.

but  I  can  st ll   f el   m s lf   f ll ng  

I am still here \

There was a moment, just before,\
where everything stood still.

I was weightless.\
Not falling. Not floating.\
Just… held.\
Held by a force that didn’t exist.

Then a sound.\
A low hum.\
But familiar.\
I listened.

The same tune\
once hummed by a boy\
who sat upon a cloud.

The boy sat in a sky of grey,\
though only to those looking up from below.\
From above, the whole world could be seen.\
There was darkness in view – lots,\
but there was also light.

I think I finally realised this.

Light will always be there,\
_h i d d e n   i n   t h e   c r a c k s_,\
in the spaces (                             ),\
| on the other side of every wall |\

Suddenly, I wasn’t held anymore.\
My feet touched the ground.\
I looked around.\
I was home.

The air was different.\
There was a peace I hadn’t felt before.\
I breathed in—\
\
\
and out.

Who can say if I’m better,\
or healed?\
Who can say if I have changed at all?\
Maybe no one.\
Maybe that’s fine.

For I remember the fall.\
I remember the boy on the cloud.\
I remember the walk.\
I remember the dark.

And I will not forget.\
Not anymore.

Darkness will come again,\
I’m learning to expect that.\
But when it does,\
I will try to meet it with whatever light I have.

For the moment,\
I am here.

For the moment,\
here is enough.
