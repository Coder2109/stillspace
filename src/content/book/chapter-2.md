# The Origins of Hollow

Hollowness doesn't appear overnight. It grows slowly, fed by the small disconnections and compromises that accumulate over time. Like erosion, it happens gradually—so gradually that you might not notice until the landscape of your inner world has fundamentally changed.

## The Slow Unraveling

Often, hollowness begins with a series of small betrayals—mostly of ourselves. We say yes when we mean no. We stay in situations that drain us. We ignore our intuition in favor of practicality. Each small compromise creates a tiny crack in our connection to ourselves.

These cracks might seem insignificant individually, but over time, they create pathways for disconnection to flow through. You wake up one day and realize you don't know what you want anymore, what you believe, or even what you feel. The person you used to be feels like a distant memory.

## The Role of Grief

Unprocessed grief is one of the most powerful contributors to hollowness. We live in a culture that rushes through grief, encouraging people to "move on" and "stay strong." But grief doesn't operate on a timeline, and when we don't allow ourselves to fully process loss, the unexpressed emotions don't disappear—they go underground.

This underground grief can manifest as hollowness. You might feel empty because you're carrying the weight of losses you never properly mourned: the death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, the loss of a dream, or even the smaller deaths that happen throughout life—friendships that fade, identities we outgrow, versions of ourselves we leave behind.

## Trauma and Disconnection

Trauma, whether big or small, fundamentally alters our relationship with ourselves and the world. When we experience something overwhelming, our minds and bodies create protective mechanisms to help us survive. These mechanisms often involve disconnection—splitting off parts of ourselves, numbing our emotions, or creating distance from our experiences.

While these protective responses serve us in the moment, they can become habitual. The disconnection that helped us survive trauma can become our default way of being in the world, long after the threat has passed.

## The Cost of Constant Adaptation

Many of us live in environments that require constant adaptation. We code-switch at work, adjust our personalities for different social groups, and modify our authentic selves to fit in. While adaptability is a valuable skill, constant adaptation without spaces to return to our authentic selves can lead to hollowness.

Imagine wearing a mask all day, every day. Eventually, you might forget what your real face looks like underneath. This is what happens when we spend too much time adapting and not enough time being ourselves.

## The Protective Function of Hollowness

It's important to recognize that hollowness isn't just a problem to be solved—it often serves a protective function. When life becomes too overwhelming, when we're carrying too much pain or responsibility, hollowness can be a way of creating space.

Like a fever, hollowness is a symptom that something needs attention. It might be telling you that you're overextended, that you need to grieve, that you're living inauthentically, or that you need support. Rather than fighting against the feeling, we can approach it with curiosity: What is this hollowness trying to tell me?
