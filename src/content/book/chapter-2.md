# On Introductions

Hello. I don't know who's reading this or how it finds you. Maybe it's just me in a few months time. I don't know where you are or when it is for you. I don't know what you are going through or how you are feeling. Maybe happy. Maybe sad. Maybe it's complicated. Maybe that is okay.

I'm not doing too well, if I'm being honest. Over these past couple of years I have suffered from a lot of depression, anxiety, panic attacks and mood swings. And most of it is still here with me today. That leads me to why I am writing this.

This is a task I’ve set myself: to write things down honestly. _On Being Hollow_ isn’t a story, and it isn’t a guide. It’s a place for all of my thoughts, observations, feelings, and whatever else feels right, all revolving around mental health and what it feels like to exist inside a human head.

I don’t know where this will lead as I write it. I don’t know whether it will change anything, whether it will help me make sense of things, or whether it will simply sit here as a record of how I felt at this point in my life. Maybe someone else finds a piece of themselves in it. Maybe it helps them. I genuinely don’t know.

I want to leave this introduction untouched after I’ve finished writing it, to keep it honest. After all, I’m still learning how to live day to day. I’m still learning what matters, and what I can let go of. I’m still learning how to be me. So here is my journey nonetheless. And this is where I start, on pages I am yet to read. 

Thanks for being here,\
Adam
